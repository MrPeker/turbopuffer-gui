# Testing

In your tests and development environment we suggest hitting production turbopuffer for the best end to end testing. Since creating a namespace in turbopuffer is virtually free, you can create a namespace for each test with a random name, and simply delete it after the test. We recommend each developer has their own namespace for their dev namespaces.

In addition, to separate test and production, consider creating a separate organization in the dashboard.
