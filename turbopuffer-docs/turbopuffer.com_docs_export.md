# Export documents

To export all documents in a namespace, use the [query](https://turbopuffer.com/docs/query) API to page
through documents by advancing a filter on the `id` attribute.

Documents inserted while the export is in progress will be included.

A common use-case for this is to copy your all documents to a different
namespace after some client-side transformation. To copy documents without
transformation, use [copy\_from\_namespace](https://turbopuffer.com/docs/write#param-copy_from_namespace)
for a more efficient server-side copy (follow with
[delete\_by\_filter](https://turbopuffer.com/docs/write/#param-delete_by_filter) to copy only a subset of
documents).
